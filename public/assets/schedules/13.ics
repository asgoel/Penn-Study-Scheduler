SUMMARY:ACCT101004
DESCRIPTION:This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and stan
 dards underlying financial accounting systems. Several important concept
 s will be studied in detail\, including: revenue recognition\, inventory
 \, long-lived assets\, present value\, and long term liabilities. The co
 urse emphasizes the construction of the basic financial accounting state
 ments - the income statement\, balance sheet\, and cash flow statement -
  as well as their interpretation.

SUMMARY:ARTH220401
DESCRIPTION:This course surveys Greek art and artifacts from Sicily to th
 e Black Sea from the 10th BCE up to the 2nd centuries BCE reaching the A
 ge of Alexander and the Hellenistic Kingdoms. Our objects range from pub
 lic sculpture and painting on and around grand buildings and gardens\, t
 o domestic luxury arts like jewelry\, cups and vases\, mosaic floors\, a
 nd the humbler objects of worship and every-day life. Greek addressed he
 roic epic\, religous and political themes\, engaged viewers' emotions\, 
 and served mundane as well as monumental aims. Current themes include Gr
 eek ways of looking at art and space\, and ideas of invention and progre
 ss\; the roll of monuments\, makers and patrons in Greek society\; and c
 onnections with the other cultures that inspired and made use of Greek a
 rtists and styles. To understand ancient viewers' encounters\, you will 
 meet the spaces of sanctuary and tomb\, house and city\, garden and priv
 ate collection\; your readings will sample ancient peoples' art writing.
  Diverse approaches introduce art historical aims and methods\, and thei
 r relationships to archaeology\, anthropology and other disciplines -- a
 lso to modern kinds of museums\, not least our own University Museum of 
 Archaeology. No prerequisites. This course fulfills the 'global requirem
 ent'. Of interest to students of classical\, middle-eastern\, visual and
  religious studies\, anthropology\, history\, communications and the GSD
  programs.

SUMMARY:CIS 240001
DESCRIPTION:You know how to program\, but do you know how computers reall
 y work? How do millions of transistors come together to form a complete 
 computing system? This bottom-up course begins with transistors and simp
 le computer hardware structures\, continues with low-level programming u
 sing primative machine instructions\, and finishes with an introduction 
 to all aspects of computer systems architecture and serves as the founda
 tion for subsequent computer systems courses\, such as Digital Systems O
 rganization and Design (CIS 371)\, Computer Operating Systems (CIS 380)\
 , and Compilers and Interpreters (CIS 341). The course will consider the
  SPARC architecture\, boolean logic\, number systems\,and computer arith
 metic\; macro assembly language programming and subroutine linkages\; th
 e operating system interface and input/output\; understanding the output
  of the C compiler\; the use of the C programming language to generate s
 pecific assembly language instructions.

SUMMARY:CIS 262001
DESCRIPTION:This course explores questions fundamental to computer scienc
 e such as which problems cannot be solved by computers\, can we formaliz
 e computing as a mathematical concept without relying upon the specifics
  of programming languages and computing platforms\, and which problems c
 an be solved efficiently. The topics include finite automata and regular
  languages\, context-free grammars and pushdown automata\, Turing machin
 es and undecidability\, tractability and NP-completeness. The course emp
 hasizes rigorous mathematical reasoning as well as connections to practi
 cal computing problems such as test processing\, parsing\, XML query lan
 guages\, and program verification.

 NCE 100 form the foundation for all elective finance courses. The main t
 opics include: 1) the time value of money and capital budgeting techniqu
 es\; 2) uncertainty and the trade-off between risk and return\; 3) secur
 ity market efficiency\; 4) optimal capital structure\, and 5) dividend p

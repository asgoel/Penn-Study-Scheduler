SUMMARY:BPUB250009
DESCRIPTION:This course introduces students to "managerial economics\," t
 he application of microeconomic theory to management problems. Microecon
 omic theory is a remarkably useful body of ideas for understanding and a
 nalyzing human behavior in a variety of contexts. Our goal in this cours
 e is to get you to internalize this body of theory well enough so that y
 ou can analyze management problems. While this is a "tools course"\, we 
 will be mindful of applied business problems throughout the course. Afte
 r presenting the competitive model we will dwell on other market structu
 res more like those encountered by typical firms (monopoly\, oligopoly\,
  monopolistic competition). We will spend some time on microeconomic les
 sons on the development and use of market power\, as well as strategic i
 nteraction among firms. Finally\, we will spend some time on the theory 
 of market failure.

SUMMARY:CIS 121001
DESCRIPTION:This is an introductory course about Basic Algorithms and Dat
 a Structures using the Java programming language. We introduce elementar
 y concepts about the complexity of an algorithm and methods for analyzin
 g the running time of software. We describe data structures like stacks\
 , queues\, lists\, trees\, priority queues\, maps\, hash tables and grap
 hs\, and we discuss how to implement them efficiently and how to use the
 m in problems-solving software. A larger project introducing students to
  some of the challenges of software development concludes the course.

SUMMARY:ESE 170001
DESCRIPTION:The course provides an introduction to modern logic design an
 d digital systems. It starts with an overview of the major building bloc
 ks of a computer. It covers combinational logic including logic gates\, 
 minimization techniques\, arithmetic circuits and modern logic devices s
 uch as programmable logic arrays. The next part deals with sequential ci
 rcuits: flip-flops\, registers memories\, and state machines. Case studi
 es of real-world applications are used to illustrate the design of seque
 ntial circuits. The use of hardware description language will be introdu
 ced. There is a companion lab-based course\, ESE 171\, required for EE/C
 MPE majors.

SUMMARY:MGMT101003
DESCRIPTION:This course addresses contemporary management challenges stem
 ming from changing organizational structures\, complex environmental con
 ditions\, new technological developments and increasingly diverse workfo
 rces. It highlights critical management issues involved in planning\, or
 ganizing\, controlling and leading an organization. This course will hel
 p you understand some of the issues involved in both managing and being 
 managed and equip you to become more effective contributors to organizat
 ions that you join. The course will cover several topics in management\,
  organization and strategy. Each topic will span one or two weeks. Topic
 s include combinations of the following areas: organizational structure\
 , organizational culture\, strategy\, interorganizational relationships\
 , job design\, groups\, reward systems\, work force composition\, power 
 and politics\, social responsibility\, organizational change\, organizat
 ional decision-making\, business history. The professor will cover an ov
 erview of the topic with frameworks and examples in the lecture and the 
 teaching assistant will lead a case discussion that integrates these fra
 meworks in the recitation.
